WOW!! From their website...\"We were delighted to work with Publicis Dublin on the inevitably high profile stings for RTE\"s Olympic coverage. Publicis have proved themselves masters of the challenging format in the past, and this time they invited Piranha Bar to create cutting edge abstract eye candy driven by athletic performance. Cadbury had already established a rich abstract world with their \"Icons\" campaign in Ireland where beautiful trails of chocolate, milk and foil interweave. PB DesignerDirector Shane Griffin delved into our Softimage ICE pipeline for the latest in particle effects and physics simulation, adding Olympic motion capture animation and taking in Quayola Memo Akten\"s great \"Forms\" piece along the way. The result is a dazzling world of glitter, crystal, shimmering geometry, swirling strands, balloons and balls that billow in the wake of an heroic sporting action. These are animated sculptures of Olympic athletes representing the fun, celebration, and visual excitement of the games, resulting in a Cadbury branded visual treat. Shane directed the motion capture shoot with our old friends Audio Motion in Oxford from the comfort of a couch in Piranha Bar. As well as having a live video stream to our talent, we were also able to simultaneously view the captured action in real time from 3 separate cameras in the studio, along with a 3D wireframe of our athlete via FTP. Selected action clips were then edited cropped live within our Internet browser window, and delivered back as 3D files. TV Sponsorship stings for RTE\"s coverage of the London 2012 Olympics.

       " 'Title: THE INVISIBLE MAN | Omeleto\\nChannel: channel29\\nYear: 2018\\nDescription: Two drug traffickers play Russian roulette. THE INVISIBLE MAN is used with permission from Hugo Keijzer. Learn more at Low-level drug traffickers, Nick and Kid, have half a million euros in heroine stashed in an upstate barn. But they also have a debt to pay -- to a canny operator named Frank, who suddenly turns up at their hideout looking to collect. When they don\\'t pony up, they\\'re obliged to settle their score with a tense game of Russian roulette -- and each round brings up a secret about each person in the room. Absurd, profane, funny and suspenseful, this short drama would be enjoyable for its top-notch performances and well-paced script. But THE INVISIBLE MAN leverages the unique qualities of VR to create a puzzlebox of a narrative. How does Frank know where the bullet is? And just who is the \"invisible man\"? The viewer can explore the immersive image to search out clues -- it might take a few views, but the answers are literally all around you.',\n",
